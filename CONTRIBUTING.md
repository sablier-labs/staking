Feel free to dive in! [Open](../../issues/new) an issue, [start](../../discussions/new) a discussion or submit a PR. For
any informal concerns or feedback, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bSwRCwWRsT).

Contributions are welcome by anyone interested in writing more tests, improving readability, optimizing for gas
efficiency, or extending the protocol via new features.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20+)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) (command runner)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (package manager)
- [Ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) (package manager resolver)
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) (EVM development framework)
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) (Rust compiler)
- [Bulloak](https://bulloak.dev) (CLI for checking tests)

In addition, familiarity with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is requisite.

## Set Up

Clone this repository;

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:sablier-labs/staking.git
```

Then, inside the project's directory, run these commands to install the Node.js dependencies and build the contracts:

```shell
$ just install
$ just build
```

Switch to the `staging` branch, where all development work should be done:

```shell
$ git switch staging
```

Now you can start making changes.

To see a list of all available scripts, run this command:

```shell
$ just --list
```

## Pull Requests

When making a pull request, ensure that:

- The base development branch is `staging`.
- All tests pass.
- Concrete tests are generated using Bulloak and the Branching Tree Technique (BTT).
  - You can learn more about this on the [Bulloak website](https://bulloak.dev).
  - If you modify a test tree, use this command to generate the corresponding test contract that complies with BTT:
    `bulloak scaffold -wf /path/to/file.tree`
- Code coverage remains the same or greater.
- All new code adheres to the style guide:
  - All lint checks pass.
  - Code is thoroughly commented with NatSpec where relevant.
- If making a change to the contracts:
  - Gas snapshots are provided and demonstrate an improvement (or an acceptable deficit given other improvements).
  - Reference contracts are modified correspondingly if relevant.
  - New tests are included for all new features or code paths.
- A descriptive summary of the PR has been provided.

## Environment Variables

### Local setup

To build locally, follow the [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file to create a `.env` file at the root of the repo and
populate it with the appropriate environment values. You need to provide your mnemonic phrase and a few API keys.

### Deployment

To make CI work in your pull request, ensure that the necessary environment variables are configured in your forked
repository's secrets. Please add the following variable in your GitHub Secrets:

- ROUTEMESH_API_KEY
