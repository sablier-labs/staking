# Security

Ensuring the security of the Sablier Protocol is our utmost priority. We have dedicated significant efforts towards the
design and testing of the protocol to guarantee its safety and reliability. However, we are aware that security is a
continuous process. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please read the
[Bug Bounty Program](https://sablier.notion.site/bug-bounty), and share a report privately with us.
